            For class we wee tasked with reading this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> on form design by Salim Ansari. The article
            was insightful and will be a useful reference for UX work. When designing a form it is crucial to keep all questions straight to the point and easy to understand. A good design will have minimal input fields. A single column 
            layout will present the information without overloading ther user. Studies have also shown that breaking down a form into steps will also prevent visual noise.
            The simplest questions should be asked at the beginning of the form and slowly ease the user into the more complicated ones. It is also noted to explain specific input 
            requirements such as, case sensitivity or character limitations for a username. All labels should be inline and above input fields for effective visual clarity.The proximity
            of each label should leave ample amounts of space between it and the input field. Input fields should also be sized to the amount of information asked for in order to not confuse the user.
            Drop down menus should be used very sparingly if at all.
