    <title>Final Project Brief</title>

    <h1>Project Brief Summary</h1>
    <p>Develop another iteration of the Every Picture project with the intended audience of children   7-10 while improving upon its functionality and visuals.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>For the final project my goal is to improve upon my Every Picture project. Stretched for time the functionality of its current state leaves something to be desired. To further iterate on its visuals to be clearer and colorful. I’d like to add more content and include proper text directions. Also to include a preloading screen and fun sound effects. Due to the nature of the project’s orientation I’d include a mobile screen that would encourage users to view the website on a desktop to experience it in its full intentionality. I want to make this iteration’s design clearer as to what it is while still utilizing abstract shape aesthetics.</p>
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>My designs as of lately take inspiration from postmodern artists and designers such as the Memphis group and Kieth Haring. Bold line work and colorful graphics to create a lasting impression on the user. I also incorporate my skills as an illustrator to create interesting assets that will be appealing to a younger audience 7 to 10 years old. I utilize line weight and gestalt principles to keep my design cohesive despite its eclectic sensibilities. Experimentation with current design trends such as gradients and retro inspired fonts.</p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>The user will be able to hover over every interactive object and trigger an animation that will notify them of its clickability. I’ll also attempt to include a changing crosshair cursor to enhance this effect. The user will be able to interact with multiple objects on the webpage and explore different aspects of my life as a designer. Images of my artwork, process, and videos of my day to day will be viewable and explained. Ideally multiple interactions will be displayed on screen. The order of each interaction should not interfere with one another.</p>
    <h2>Expierence Goals</h2>
    <p>I intend to create a cozy and familiar experience for users of a younger demographic. An enjoyable experience of exploring my website through fun colorful visuals with sounds and music. The intended audience will be given a fun glimpse into a potential line of work making this project semi-educational. I feel with this clearer goal in mind the overall project will be a lot more cohesive and understood by the audience. I plan to gather more feedback on my design and begin the process of editing my assets while creating more to build upon the first iteration. I’ll be seeking guidance to create more functional code and overall a better experience for my users.</p>
